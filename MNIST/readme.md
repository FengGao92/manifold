This contains example codes for MNIST tasks, for both rotated and unrotated digits. 1. run generate_signals.py to generate rotated (unrotated if modified) MNIST dataset; 2. run generate_scattering_coeff.py to generate scattering coeffcients; 3. run MNIST_classification.py to perform classification of MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is projected to a sphere, and EIGEN contains eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the mesh.
